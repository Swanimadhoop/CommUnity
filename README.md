Project Description
CommUnity is a social platform designed to connect individuals within local communities. It allows users to create profiles, share posts, join discussions, and engage with others based on common interests. The app leverages real-time communication features, providing seamless interactions and building stronger local connections.

The Problem Statement
Many local communities lack a centralized platform for individuals to connect, share ideas, and collaborate. CommUnity addresses this gap by providing a social networking platform focused on building stronger local connections and fostering real-time communication.

The Solution
We stumbled upon the solution while brainstorming over coffee (and maybe a bit of code). Realizing that everyone loves to chat, share ideas, and make connections, we decided to build a space where local communities could come together digitally, share experiences, and create events.

Technical Details
Technologies/Components Used
For Software
Language Used: Javascript(for both frontend and backend)
Frameworks Used: React.js, Node.js, Express.js
Libraries used: React Router, JWT, Axios, Mongoose, Bcrypt, Dotenv
Tools used: MongoDB Atlas, Postman, Git, VS Code, npm

Implementation(For software)
The implementation of the software involves setting up a React.js frontend where users can register, log in, and post issues categorized into four groups. The Node.js backend, powered by Express.js, handles user authentication, stores posts in a MongoDB database, and allows users to like and comment on posts. Users must be logged in to post, and all actions like commenting and liking are stored and managed in the backend. The project is deployed with MongoDB Atlas for database hosting and the frontend and backend on platforms like Heroku or Netlify.

Installation Commands:
npm install
npm axios react-router-dom
npm mongoose

Run Commands:
