Community is a wellness-driven web application that allows users to share and seek help by posting requests and offers. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), the platform provides features such as user authentication with login and signup functionalities, categorized post feeds, and the ability to create new posts when logged in. The application ensures a seamless user experience with an intuitive interface and secure interactions. Deployed using cloud services, it aims to connect people locally and foster mutual assistance within communities.
